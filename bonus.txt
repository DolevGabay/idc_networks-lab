our bonus implements:
we added a list on emails to the MultiThreadedWebServer so the user can add new email from index.html 
see all the existing email on param_info.
we also add a "delete email" functionality, you can input the uuid of the email you wish to delete, and the server will handle the 
"/delete" endpoint that the html will request.
the server will also notify to the server if the delete action succeeded.
