our bonus implements:
we added a list of emails to the MultiThreadedWebServer so the user can add new email from index.html and
see all the existing email on param_info.
we also add a "delete email" functionality, the user can input the uuid of the email he wishes to delete, and the server will handle the 
"/delete" endpoint that the html will request.
the server will also notify to the server if the delete action succeeded.
